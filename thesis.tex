privacy enhancing technologies
youtube-like, social media experience

social media is dominated by silicon valley

we transfered the first generation bash script into a more involved python toolchain ecosystem
the p4a project accepted our first contribution the same day
our approach for this .. we focussed on the low hanging fruit first to benefit from the learning effect
the first task consisted of porting the python bindings for 15 ->30+ commonly used libraries to Android [recipe example code block]

cross-compile boost libs compileflags just PTHREADS
python bindings libtorrent soname conflict


sqlite3 builtin module (CPPFLAGS instead of CFLAGS, no patch setup.py after all, dispersy doesn't use aspw)


no shell acces from Popen() means only single binaries instead of normal commands

adding a native jni start environment shifts keyword arguments
