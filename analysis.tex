Clean experiment: no prior exchanges in the database

 


The bandwidth accounting system for the anonymous tunnels, multi-chain, should be capable of holding records on a very large scale.
We conducted an experiment with registering 10.000 blocks between 2 peers, on 5 different models of phones.
Figure \ref{fig:multichain_scale} shows that the curve is not scaling linearly.

The database size appear to have a large impact on the performance. \cite{db_performance}
