  abstract  = {Social networking Web sites, which allow users to create identities and link them to friends who have also created identities, are highly popular. Systems such as Facebook and MySpace utilize a traditional client-server approach to achieve this, which means that all identities and their social links (the entire social network) are stored and administered on central servers. Although this approach supports highly mobile user access - users can log-in from any computer - it also poses high dependence on predefined central server(s), which results in possible exploitation of private data.In this paper we present an alternative approach, based on gossip protocol, in which we use a completely decentralized peer-to-peer system to create and store the social network. Our system is self-administered and works in a highly transient environment of peer availability. We propose the design and implementation in Tribler of a distributed social networking system that is scalable and robust, allowing users to perform core social networking functions of establishing and removing social links without any requirement for centralized servers or administration.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor has become one of the most popular overlay networks
for anonymizing TCP traffic. Its popularity is due in part
to its perceived strong anonymity properties and its relatively
low latency service. Low latency is achieved through
Tor’s ability to balance the traffic load by optimizing Tor
router selection to probabilistically favor routers with highbandwidth
capabilities.
We investigate how Tor’s routing optimizations impact its
ability to provide strong anonymity. Through experiments
conducted on PlanetLab, we show the extent to which routing
performance optimizations have left the system vulnerable
to end-to-end traffic analysis attacks from non-global
adversaries with minimal resources. Further, we demonstrate
that entry guards, added to mitigate path disruption
attacks, are themselves vulnerable to attack. Finally, we explore
solutions to improve Tor’s current routing algorithms
and propose alternative routing strategies that prevent some
of the routing attacks used in our experiments.},

Such an attack can be used by malicious or compromised nodes to identify the rest of the circuit, or as the first step in a follow-on trace-back attack. Our intuition is that by modulating the bandwidth of an anonymous connection (e.g. when the destination server, its router, or an entry point is under our control), we create observable fluctuations that propagate through the Tor network and the Internet to the end-user's host. To that end, we employ LinkWidth, a novel bandwidth-estimation technique. LinkWidth enables network edge-attached entities to estimate the available bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host, router, or ISP. Our approach also does not require compromise of any Tor nodes. In a series of experiments against the Tor network, we show that we can accurately identify the network location of most participating Tor relays.},

  Abstract                 = {Recommendation systems are important in social networks
that allow the injection of user-generated content and let
users indicate their preferences towards the content introduced
by others. Considering the increase of usage of these
collaborative systems, it seems only a matter of time before
the current centralized systems will be replaced by decentralized
solutions. However, current collaborative filtering
systems assume that recommendations can be based on the
entire data collection in the network.
This work evaluates the performance of user-based collaborative
filtering systems when only partial knowledge about
the network is available at an end-user’s computer. We propose
a utility model that combines three important aspects
of network users (similarity, confidence and usefulness) in
order to create a semantic overlay network optimized for autonomous
content recommendations. We compare different
similarity functions on the most common dataset in collaborative
filtering and we show the influence of the confidence
and usefulness parameters on both dense and sparse data.
We find that the commonly used similarity function results
in sub-optimal performance when used as updating
criterion for locally stored rating profiles. We show that
taking into account the level of confidence in the computed
similarity can greatly improve recommendation accuracy, especially
when a small user neighborhood is selected. Also,
conventional methods select many users that cannot contribute
to the recommendation, because they have rated too
few items. The usefulness parameter that we introduce compensates
for this problem, so that even a small local cache
in very sparse data provides valuable recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet censorship is on the rise as websites around the world are increasingly blocked by
government-level firewalls. Although popular anonymizing networks like Tor were originally
designed to keep attackers from tracing people’s activities, many people are also using them to
evade local censorship. But if the censor simply denies access to the Tor network itself, blocked
users can no longer benefit from the security Tor offers.
Here we describe a design that builds upon the current Tor network to provide an anonymizing
network that resists blocking by government-level attackers.},

Tor works on the real-world Internet, requires no special privileges or kernel modifications, requires little synchronization or coordination between nodes, and provides a reasonable tradeoff between anonymity, usability, and efficiency. We briefly describe our experiences with an international network of more than 30 nodes. We close with a list of open problems in anonymous communication.},

  Abstract                 = {A challenging problem in dissent networking is that of circumventing large-scale communication blackouts imposed
by oppressive governments. Although prior work has not focused on the need for user anonymity, we contend that it is essential. Without anonymity, governments can use communication networks to track and persecute users. A key challenge for decentralized networks is that of resource allocation and control. Network resources must be shared in a manner that deprioritizes unwanted traffic and abusive users. This task is typically addressed through reputation systems that conflict with anonymity. Our work addresses this paradox: We prioritize resources in a privacy-preserving manner to create an attack-resilient, anonymity-preserving, mobile ad-hoc network. Our prioritization mechanism exploits the properties of a social trust graph to promote messages relayed via trusted nodes. We present Rangzen, a microblogging solution that uses smartphones to opportunistically relay messages among citizens in a delay-tolerant network (DTN) that is independent of government or corporate-controlled infrastructure.},

Essential resources for a P2P system are: bandwidth, injections, moderations,

addressing the inducement of cooperation in a P2P-TV system called Tribler.
This theory helps to explain how the acceptability of delayed reciprocity can be
influenced by the specificity of the exchangeable resources and by the relationship
types between individuals. This paper presents the results from a study
among 36 participants about the acceptability of delayed reciprocity in a P2PTV
system, under varying relationship types and specificity of exchangeable

  Abstract                 = {The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm provides a data distribution
model that may be attractive for Video on Demand (VoD)
as it allows to decrease the costs and to increase the scalability
of video distribution. However, VoD is more challenging
for P2P technology than file sharing or live streaming, and
so, practically feasible VoD systems proposed to date rely on
a backend server infrastructure as a fail-over solution. In this
paper we investigate how the dependency on servers can be decreased
by optimizing the video piece-selection strategy and by
allowing multiple peers to form a collaboration for obtaining
a single video. In a set of simulations of a trace-based system
model we show that for systems such as YouTube the proposed
optimizations would result in savings of as much as 70% of the
server bandwidth. These simulation results confirm the conclusions
of an analytical study of our optimizations, the essential
part of which is also included in this paper.},

protocol. Much BitTorrent activity takes place within
private virtual communities called “Private Trackers” - a server
that allows only community members to share files. Many private
trackers implement “ratio enforcement” where the tracker monitors
the upload and download behaviour of peers. If a peer
downloads substantially more than it uploads then service is
terminated. Tracker policies related to credit effect the performance
of the community as a whole. We identify the possibility
of a “credit squeeze” in which performance is reduced due to
lack of credit for some peers. We consider statistics from a
popular private tracker and results from a simple model (called
“BitCrunch”).},

  abstract  = {Large-scale communications blackouts, such as those
carried out by Egypt and Libya in 2011 and Syria in
2012 and 2013, have motivated a series of projects that
aim to enable citizens to communicate even in the face
of such heavy-handed censorship efforts. A common
theme across these proposals has been the use of wireless
mesh networks. We argue that such networks are
poorly equipped to serve as a meaningful countermeasure
against large-scale blackouts due to their intrinsically
poor scaling properties. We further argue that
projects in this space must consider user safety as first
design priority and thus far have failed to preserve user
anonymity and to rely only on innocuous hardware.
From these two insights, we frame a definition of dissent
networks to capture the essential requirements for
blackout circumvention solutions.},

One consequence of these goals is that these services leak some information about the network latency between the sender and one or more nodes in the system. We present two attacks on low-latency anonymity schemes using this information. The first attack allows a pair of colluding Web sites to predict, based on local timing information and with no additional resources, whether two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit with high confidence. The second attack requires more resources but allows a malicious Web site to gain several bits of information about a client each time he visits the site. We evaluate both attacks against two low-latency anonymity protocols—the Tor network and the MultiProxy proxy aggregator service—and conclude that both are highly vulnerable to these attacks.},

are now able to benefit from network and location
awareness. It is therefore crucial to understand the relation
between underlay and overlay networks and to characterize
the behavior of real users with regard to the Internet. For
this purpose, we have designed and implemented MULTIPROBE,
a framework for large-scale P2P file-sharing measurements.
Using this framework, we have performed measurements of
BitTorrent, which is currently the P2P file sharing network with
the largest amount of Internet traffic. We analyze and correlate
these measurements to provide new insights into the topology,
the connectivity, and the path characteristics of the Internet
parts underlying P2P networks, as well as to present unique
information on the BitTorrent throughput and connectivity.},

the sheer volume of available information makes it hardly useful in the absence of a fast and accurate

But people must download files to run those programs--a risk in Iran, where having such files on your computer can lead to jail. Psiphon, is Web-based: Users download nothing, leaving no clues for snoops. It could open the Internet to thousands of students who use public terminals. To use Psiphon, people in censored countries need social connections to people in uncensored countries, and Western universities house huge populations of technology-savvy and politically fired-up foreigners. Psiphon's reliance on social networks means censored users will find circumvention easier than ever.},

In a climate of cold war between these users and anti-piracy groups, more and more users are moving to anonymizing networks in an attempt to hide their identity. However, when not designed to protect users information, a P2P protocol would leak information that may compromise the identity of its users. In this paper, we first present three attacks targeting BitTorrent users on top of Tor that reveal their real IP addresses. In a second step, we analyze the Tor usage by BitTorrent users and compare it to its usage outside of Tor. Finally, we depict the risks induced by this de-anonymization and show that users' privacy violation goes beyond BitTorrent traffic and contaminates other protocols such as HTTP.},

  Abstract                 = {A well-known problem in P2P systems is freeriding, where
users do not share content if there is no incentive to do so.
In this paper, we distinguish lazy freeriders that are merely
reluctant to share but follow the protocol, versus die-hard
freeriders that employ sophisticated methods to subvert the
protocol. Existing incentive designs often provide theoretically
attractive resistance against die-hard freeriding, yet are
rarely deployed in real networks because of practical infeasibility.
Meanwhile, real communities benefit greatly from
prevention of lazy freeriding, but have only centralized technology
available to do so. We present a lightweight, fully
distributed mechanism called BARTERCAST that prevents
lazy freeriding and is deployed in practice. BarterCast uses
a maxflow reputation algorithm based on a peer’s private
history of its data exchanges as well as indirect information
received from other peers. We assess different reputation
policies under realistic, trace-based community conditions
and show that our mechanism is consistent and effective,
even when significant fractions of peers spread false information.
Furthermore, we present results of the deployment
of BarterCast in the BitTorrent-based Tribler network which
currently has thousands of users worldwide.},

Research has shown that implementations of this idea are scarce. Since the
project is assigned by the group responsible for creating Tribler, this project
follows their example in programming languages and libraries, such as Python
and Twisted.
Development of Tsukiji occurred in sprints of around 1 week, each sprint
focusing on one or two specific features. Meetings with the product owner were
planned after every development cycle, giving us feedback on the previous sprint
and guiding the focus of the following sprint.
The result is a light-weight, terminal-based, python application called Tsuk-
iji. Users can post offers on the network and trade commodities for money.
They communicate by sending messages using the gossip protocol, implemented
with the Twisted library. Financial transactions are made using PayPal. With
this, a fully decentralised market with a trustworthy payment system is created,
allowing users to make trades without the risk of their trading platform being
shut down.},

  Abstract                 = {Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks depend on peers uploading
data to each other. Some peers, called free-riders,
will not upload data unless there is an incentive to do so.
Algorithms designed to prevent free-riding typically assume
that connectivity is not a problem. However, on the Internet,
a large fraction of the peers resides behind a firewall
or NAT, making them unable to accept incoming connections.
In this paper, we will prove that it is impossible to
prevent free-riding when more than half of the peers are
firewalled, and we will provide bounds on the sharing ratios
(defined as the number of bytes uploaded divided by the
number of bytes downloaded) of both firewalled and non-
firewalled peers. Firewall puncturing techniques are complex
but can be used to connect two firewalled peers; we will
provide a bound on their required effectiveness in order to
achieve fairness.
We confirm our theory by simulating individual BitTorrent
swarms (sets of peers that download the same file), and
show that the theoretical bounds can be met in systems with
many firewalled peers. We have also collected statistics
covering thousands of BitTorrent swarms in several communities,
both open and closed; the latter ban peers if their
sharing ratios drop below a certain treshhold. We found
45% of the peers to be firewalled in the closed communities,
as opposed to 66% in the open communities, which
correlates with our theory that to obtain fair sharing ratios
for all peers, at most half of them can be behind firewalls.},

  Abstract                 = {Centralised solutions for Video-on-Demand (VoD) services, which stream pre-recorded video content to multiple clients
who start watching at the moments of their own choosing, are not scalable because of the high bandwidth requirements of
the central video servers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques which let the clients distribute the video content among themselves,
can be used to alleviate this problem. However, such techniques may introduce the problem of free-riding, with some peers
in the P2P network not forwarding the video content to others if there is no incentive to do so. When the P2P network
contains too many free-riders, an increasing number of the well-behaving peers may not achieve high enough download
speeds to maintain an acceptable service. In this paper we propose Give-to-Get, a P2P VoD algorithm which discourages
free-riding by letting peers favour uploading to other peers who have proven to be good uploaders. As a consequence,
free-riders are only tolerated as long as there is spare capacity in the system. Our simulations show that even if 20% of
the peers are free-riders, Give-to-Get continues to provide good performance to the well-behaving peers. In particular, they
show that Give-to-Get performs very well for short videos, which dominate the current VoD traffic on the Internet.},

Both the EFF and Reporters Without Borders have issued guides that describe using hidden services via Tor to protect the safety of dissidents as well as to resist censorship. We present fast and cheap attacks that reveal the location of a hidden server. Using a single hostile Tor node we have located deployed hidden servers in a matter of minutes. Although we examine hidden services over Tor, our results apply to any client using a variety of anonymity networks. In fact, these are the first actual intersection attacks on any deployed public network: thus confirming general expectations from prior theory and simulation. We recommend changes to route selection design and implementation for Tor. These changes require no operational increase in network overhead and are simple to make; but they prevent the attacks we have demonstrated. They have been implemented},

  Abstract                 = {When choosing the three relays that compose a circuit, Tor
selects the first hop among a restricted number of relays called entry
guards, pre-selected by the user himself. The reduced number of entry
guards, that until recently was fixed to three, helps in mitigating the
effects of several traffic analysis attacks. However, recent literature indicates
that the number should be further reduced, and the time during
which the user keeps the relays as guards increased. Therefore, developers
of Tor recently proposed selecting only one entry guard, which is to
be used by the user for all circuits and for a prolonged period of time
(nine months). While this design choice was made to increase the security
of the protocol, it also opens an unprecedented opportunity for a
market mechanism where relays get paid for traffic by the users.
In this paper, we propose to use the entry guard as the point-of-sale: users
subscribe to their entry guard of choice, and deposit an amount that will
be used for paying for the circuits. From the entry guard, income is then
distributed to the other relays included in circuits through an interrelay
accounting system. While the user may pay the entry guard using
BitCoins, or any other anonymous payment system, the relays exchange
I Owe You (IOU) certificates during communication, and settle their
balances only at synchronized, later points in time. This novel deferred
payment approach overcomes the weaknesses of the previously proposed
Tor payment mechanisms: we separate the user’s payment from the interrelay
payments, and we effectively unlink both from the chosen path, thus
preserving the secrecy of the circuit.},

and Tribler. The measurements show the two sides of peer production, the pirate side
with free availability of Hollywood movies on these P2P systems and the Samaritan side
exhibited by the quick joining of 400,000+ people in a community to organize protests
against events in Burma. The telecommunications and content industry are disrupted by
this way of peer production. As a consequence, revenues of both industries are likely to
suffer in the coming years. On the other hand, innovative P2P systems could win the
battle on merit over classical distribution technologies. As a result, a continuation is
expected of both legal actions against P2P and possible blocking actions of P2P traffic,
violating net neutrality. It is argued that this hinders innovation and causes a large
discrepancy between legal and user perspectives. A reform of copyright laws is clearly
needed, otherwise they will be unenforceable around 2010.},

despite the increasing attention of both the research community and large numbers of
users, the actual behavior of these systems over prolonged periods of time is still poorly understood.
This paper presents a detailed measurement study over a period of eight months
of BitTorrent/Suprnova, a P2P file-sharing system that is quickly gaining in popularity. In
particular, we show measurement results of the popularity and the availability of BitTorrent,
of its download performance, of the content lifetime, and of the structure of the community
responsible for verifying uploaded content. We also propose improvements to BitTorrent to
increase its availability and performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Most current peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle-sharing systems treat their users as anonymous, unrelated entities, and
completely disregard any social relationships between them. However, social phenomena such as friendship
and the existence of communities of users with similar tastes or interests may well be exploited in such
systems in order to increase their usability and performance. In this paper we present a novel social-based
P2P ﬁle-sharing paradigm that exploits social phenomena by maintaining social networks and using these
in content discovery, content recommendation, and downloading. Based on this paradigm’s main concepts
such as taste buddies and friends, we have designed and implemented the TRIBLER P2P ﬁle-sharing system
as a set of extensions to BitTorrent. We present and discuss the design of TRIBLER, and we show evidence
that TRIBLER enables fast content discovery and recommendation at a low additional overhead, and a
signiﬁcant improvement in download performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Broadband Internet access using ADSL or cable
modems provides sufficient bandwidth for real-time video
streaming. If television channels could be distributed on the
Internet, each channel would get a world wide audience.
However, television distribution from a single server does
not scale and IP-level multicasting is complex and costly.
We propose a solution based on application-level multicasting
using a P2P network, called P2P-TV. Each peer receives
a video stream and must also forward this stream
to others. This paper presents an architecture for streaming
video. Our P2P-TV proposal aims to solve three problems
that are currently not addressed in other P2P streaming
proposals, namely 1) maximizing the usage of all available
peer bandwidth, 2) taking current network conditions into
account (network awareness), and 3) the Freeriding problem.
Multiple Description Coding is an integral part of our
solution. By splitting the video stream into smaller streams
we can utilize all the bandwidth of a peer. Multiple streams
allow more efficient adaptation of the multicast tree to current
network conditions. Bittorrent-like bartering of content
is also enabled by using multiple streams.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last few years, much research has been performed on epidemic (or gossiping) protocols, but
much of it is of a theoretical nature, which leads to the question how such protocols would perform in
practice. To address this issue, we present the first large-scale Internet-deployed epidemic protocol, or
rather, protocol stack, called BuddyCast. BuddyCast is the core of our Tribler P2P file sharing software,
which has been downloaded over 150,000 times, and has gone through a number of versions as a result
of our experience with its actual deployment in the Internet.
We formulate three challenges for Internet-deployed epidemic protocols: they have to address availability,
connectivity, and security. Measurements of BuddyCast show that it does address the first two
of these challenges, among other things by maintaining a live overlay. As a first step towards addressing
the security challenge, we demonstrate that the BarterCast protocol in the BuddyCast protocol stack
is effective at spreading information on bartering activity, which enables the calculation of reputations.
With BuddyCast we have for the first time moved epidemic protocols from the realm of trusted ideal
environments into the complicated environment of the Internet.},

robustness to spam attacks, where metadata does not reflect the
content it is attached to, by controlling metadata spreading and

Our design is light-weight, fully decentralized and offers good

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present and evaluate a method for video
distribution through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network using
Multiple Description Coding in a multicast tree. Our
method solves the problem of serving many clients with
heterogeneous bandwidths. Every node forwards descriptions
to other nodes. Nodes that have sufficient bandwidth
are then able to receive more descriptions, and thereby
to increase the quality. We use a combination of a layered
video codec and erasure coding to generate multiple
descriptions. Given different client-bandwidth distribution
functions, we optimize a fairness criterion such as the
(average) quality for all clients. Since we optimize the
average quality for all clients as a group, the performance
for individual clients may be very different. We discuss the
reduction in quality for clients that have bandwidths other
than average as opposed to a single description stream.
Finally, we discuss the efficiency, in terms of bit rate and
redundancy, for all clients as a group, and individually.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network.

One of the factors that causes the latency lies in Tor's circuit scheduling algorithm, which allows busy circuits (those with continuous traffic) to crowd out bursty circuits (those with short bursts of traffic). In this work, we propose and implement a more advanced scheduling algorithm which treats circuits differently, based on their recent activity. In this way, bursty circuits such as those used for web browsing can gain higher priority over busy ones such as used for bulk transfer; the performance for most activities over Tor is improved, while minimal overhead is incurred. Our algorithm has been incorporated into the latest build of Tor.},

  abstract  = {Tribler is a decentralized peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing system. Recently the Tribler development team
has introduced anonymous internet communication using a Tor-like protocol in their trial version.
The goal of our bachelor project is to port this technology to Android devices. This is a challenging
task because cross-compiling the necessary libraries to the ARM CPU architecture is uncharted
territory. We have successfully ported all dependencies of Tribler to Android. An application
called Android Tor Tribler Tunneling (AT3) has been developed that tests whether these libraries
work. This application downloads a test torrent and measures information such as CPU usage and
download speed. Based on this information we have concluded that it is currently not viable to
run the anonymous tunnels on an Android smartphone. Creating circuits with several hops that
use encryption is very computationally expensive and modern smartphones can hardly keep up.
By using optimized cryptographic libraries such as gmp or with the recently announced ARMv8
architecture which supports hardware-accelerated AES encryption, creating such circuits might
become possible.},

Personalization allows users to browse programs much more efficiently according to their

P2P systems considerably, by increasing content availability, trust and the realization of
proper incentives to exchange content. This paper presents a novel scheme, called
BuddyCast, that builds such a social network for a user by exchanging user interest profiles
using exploitation and exploration principles. Additionally, we show how the interest of a
user in TV programs can be predicted from the zapping behavior by the introduced useritem
relevance models, thereby avoiding the explicit rating of TV programs. Further, we
present how the social network of a user can be used to realize a truly distributed
recommendation of TV programs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel user interface for the
personalized peer-to-peer television system that encompasses a personalized tag-based
navigation to browse the available distributed content. The user interface also visualizes the
social network of a user, thereby increasing community feeling which increases trust
amongst users and within available content and creates incentives of to exchange content
within the community.},

more popular to share information such as, for example,
multimedia files. Since this information is
stored locally at the different peers, it is necessary
to facilitate the search in an intelligent way. Collaborative
filtering is such a search technique that enables
to incorporate the preferences of a user that can
be learned from the download activities of the users.
To be effective collaborative filtering requires a large
database that captures these activities. Within a peerto-peer
network this is, however, not readily available.
Here, we propose a collaborative filtering approach
that is self-organizing and operates in a distributed
way. Information about the similarity between multimedia
files (items) is stored locally at these items
in so called item-based buddy tables. We propose to
use the language model (popular within information
retrieval) to build recommendations for the different
users based on the buddy tables of those items a user
has downloaded previously (indicating the preference
of the user). We have tested and compared our distributed
collaborative filtering approach to centralized
collaborative filtering and showed that it has similar
performance. It is therefore a promising technique
to facilitate the search for information in peer-to-peer

  Abstract                 = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have developed into popular
media to share and seek information. Given the large amount
of information available, it is of great interest to design a
distributed recommender system, to personalize the information
seeking in these networks. This paper describes a
distributed collaborative filtering framework. In this framework,
we introduce an item ranking model for collaborative
filtering, inspired by the Probability Ranking Principle
(PRP) of information retrieval. However, the probability estimation
for the item ranking requires a centralized database
to store user preferences. Within a P2P network such a
centralized database is not readily available. To overcome
this problem, we developed a novel preference exchange algorithm
called BuddyCast, based on the epidemic protocol.
Under this overlay network, the distributed item ranking is
realized by fully decomposing the computation loads of the
model and preference data into the entire network. The formal
derivation and analysis in this paper help us to outline
and motivate possible future directions of research in P2P
Recommender Systems.
The distributed recommendation framework described in
this paper has been implemented in our Open Source P2P
file sharing software Tribler (tribler.org).},

In 2013, the number of smartphones sold to consumers stood at over 967 million units, an increase of over fifty percent on the figure from 2011. This means that almost 20 percent of the world’s total population owned a smart device in 2013, a figure that is expected to increase to 34 percent by 2017. In the same year smartphone penetration is set to reach 62.2 percent in North America and 65.8 percent in Western Europe. This is a large rise in the 29.3 percent of people in North America and 22.7 percent of Western Europeans who had smartphones in 2011.

In the United States alone, sales of smartphones are projected to be worth over 40 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, an increase from 18 billion dollars in 2010. By 2017, it is forecast that almost 80 percent of all mobile users in the United States will own a smartphone, an increase from the 26.9 percent of mobile users in 2010. The Chinese smartphone market is also on the rise with over 538 million units of smartphones forecast to be sold in 2016. This is a huge increase on the 80 million that were sold in 2011.},

and security agencies’ prying eyes away from their online activity. Anonymity - Inter-
net anonymity, specifically - has therefore gained traction in recent years. In order to
further contribute to the effort of Internet privacy and anonymity, this project’s goal
was to create an Android mobile application that allows users to anonymously stream
videos from a decentralized network of peers. The main piece of software used to
achieve this goal was Tribler, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing program that provides
users the ability to download their files anonymously. Since Tribler is not written for
mobile devices, it, along with all of its dependencies, needed to be cross-compiled for
the ARM CPU architecture. All of Tribler’s dependencies were successfully ported,
except for a cryptography library due to its lack of stability and maturity. As a result
of this, an application was created that successfully streams video from a decentralized
network of peers, but without the ability to do so anonymously. Even though anony-
mous streaming is not yet working, that functionality can be easily implemented in
the application when the necessary cryptography library becomes mature and stable
enough for cross-compilation.},

Prosumption involves both production and consumption rather than focusing on either one (production) or the other (consumption). It is maintained that earlier forms of capitalism (producer and consumer capitalism) were themselves characterized by prosumption. Given the recent explosion of user-generated content online, we have reason to see prosumption as increasingly central. In prosumer capitalism, control and exploitation take on a different character than in the other forms of capitalism: there is a trend toward unpaid rather than paid labor and toward offering products at no cost, and the system is marked by a new abundance where scarcity once predominated. These trends suggest the possibility of a new, prosumer, capitalism.},

  abstract    = {P2P-netwerken maken gebruik van de beschikbare middelen van peers voor het redu-
ceren, of elimineren van de noodzaak van een server. Om dit mogelijk te maken zijn
protocollen ontwikkeld die tot doel hebben om peers efficient samen te werken. Toch
kunnen dezelfde protocollen peers een gemakkelijk doelwit maken, omdat hun be-
reidheid om samen te werken gevoelig voor aanvallen is. Er bestaat een aanzienlijke
hoeveelheid onderzoek naar het verminderen van kwetsbaarheden van peers, echter
de meeste onderzoeken zijn gedaan in de context van file-sharing of in een back-up
oplossingen. In dit proefschrift kijken we naar andere vormen van samenwerking in
een P2P-systeem waarbij nadelen van gecentraliseerde oplossingen, bijvoorbeeld het
gebrek aan privacy, worden verminderd.
In Hoofdstuk 2 introduceren we Tribler, een programma dat in ons onderzoek
gebruikt is als testbed en ons in staat stelt de prestaties van nieuwe protocollen in
het wild te evalueren. Tribler is een open-source BitTorrent-client, die is ontwikkeld
met behulp van meerdere Europese projecten. Naast het downloaden van BitTorrent
bestanden, voegt Tribler decentraal zoeken, kanalen en video-on-demand toe.
In Hoofdstuk 3 ontwerpen, implementeren en evalueren wij een platform waarmee
peers hun databases kunnen sychronizeren in een netwerk. Met ons platform kunnen
peers successvol synchroniseren wanneer ze worden blootgesteld aan wegvallende
netwerkverbindingen, NAT-firewalls, en substantiele churn. Peers synchroniseren
met elkaar mbv Bloom filters, die hun in staat stellen om de huidige stand van
hun database uit te drukken in een 1500 byte UDP bericht. Na ontvangst van een
dergelijk synchronisatie verzoek, zal een peer antwoorden met de rijen niet in de
Bloom filter zitten.
Voortbouwend op het in het vorige hoofdstuk geintroduceerde platform, intro-
duceren we Open2Edit in Hoofdstuk 4. Open2Edit is bedoeld om de samenwerking
tussen peers in een gedecentraliseerde manier te verbeteren. Het bouwt voort op
ideeen gebruikt door gecentraliseerde websites zoals Wikipedia en StackExchange.
Echter in tegenstelling tot vergelijkbare papers, implementeren we niet nog een de-
centrale versie van Wikipedia, maar een flexibel samenwerkingsplatform dat in staat
is om in een breed scala aan gebruiksscenarios toegepast te worden. Door Open2Edit
combineren met Tribler, implementeren en evalueren we een Youtube-achtig media
sharing systeem waarin gebruikers kanalen kunnen aanmaken, bestaande uit de in-
houd die zij zelf uit kiezen. Andere peers kunnen een kanaal markeren als favoriet,
en door het combineren van deze stemmen ontdekken ze de populairste kanalen.
Tijdens de integratie in Tribler werden meer dan 100.000 stemmen uitgebracht door
gebruikers.
Vervolgens benutten we in Hoofdstuk 5 bestaande oplossingen voor het Private
Set Intersection probleem om een semantisch netwerk te bouwen met behoud van
privacy. Een semantisch netwerk levert aanzienlijke prestatieverbeteringen op tij-
dens het zoeken naar informatie in een P2P-systeem, omdat relevante informatie
zich dichter bij de peer die de zoekopdracht uitvoert bevind. Echter de zijn de pres-
taties van de PSI algoritmen zijn nooit vergeleken met elkaar met betrekking tot
processortijd, bandbreedte, en hun invloed bij het bepalen overlap. Dat doen wij in
dit hoofdstuk.
In Hoofdstuk 6, gebruikmakend van een van de geevalueerde PSI algoritmen,
implementeren we een file sharing system dat de privacy van zijn gebruikers waar-
borgt. In tegenstelling tot vergelijkbare papers, gebruikt 4P geen flooding om het
P2P systeem te doorzoeken. Het maakt gebruik van de semantisch netwwerk, waar-
door 4P het aantal berichten wat wordt verzonden per query kan verminderen. In
dit hoofdstuk passen wij anonimisering technieken toe om het zoek pad te verhullen.
Daarnaast sturen peers probabilistich berichten door, en gebruiken zij versleutelde
verbindingen. Door een kleine wijziging in het PSI algoritme, voegen we een mecha-
nisme toe waarmee twee peers een sessie-sleutel kunnen afspreken die wordt gebruikt
om de verbinding te versleutelen. Deze sessie-sleutel kan niet worden onderschept,
of aangepast door een man-in-the-middle omdat hij versleuteld is met de sleutel van
de initierende peer. Tijdens de evaluatie vergelijken we 4P met andere technieken
en laten zien dat het aanzienlijk minder berichten (300 in plaats van 10.000) vereist
per zoek opdracht.
Tenslotte, in Hoofdstuk 7, ontwerpen en evalueren wij een volledig gedecentra-
liseerd sociaal netwerk dat hetzelfde PSI algoritme gebruikt om vrienden te vinden
die nu online zijn. Na het opbouwen van een directe verbinding met die vrienden, of
peers die ten minste een vriend gemeen hebben, synchronizeren deze peers berichten
met behulp van een licht aangepast algoritme zoals geintroduceerd in Hoofdstuk 3.
Elke update wordt versleuteld met de publieke sleutel van de uiteindelijke bestem-
ming, en wordt gerepliceert naar alle van de vrienden van de bestemming. Dit
resulteert in een cooperatief sociaal netwerk waarin vrienden berichten opslaan be-
stemt voor hun vrienden en vice versa. Dit heeft als voordeel dat het systeem geen
replicatie strategieen nodig heeft, omdat hun vrienden voldoende replicas bieden.},

  abstract    = {A key challenge in censorship circumvention is being able to direct legitimate
users to redirection proxies while preventing censors, posing as insiders, from
discovering their addresses and blocking them. In this thesis, we study how to
protect and/or design censorship circumvention systems to resist the insider
attacks.
Tor is one of the most popular censorship circumvention systems; it uses
bridges run by volunteers as proxies to evade censorship. We propose rBridge–
a user reputation system for bridge distribution; it assigns bridges according
to the past history of users to limit corrupt users from repeatedly blocking
bridges, and employs an introduction-based mechanism to invite new users
while resisting Sybil attacks. Our evaluation results show that rBridge pro-
vides much stronger protection for bridges than any existing scheme. We also
address another important challenge to the bridge distribution—preserving
the privacy of users’ bridge assignment information, which can be exploited
by malicious parties to degrade users’ anonymity in anonymous communica-
tion.
We propose a new framework for censorship-resistant web browsing called
CensorSpoofer that addresses this challenge by exploiting the asymmetric na-
ture of web browsing traffic and making use of IP spoofing. CensorSpoofer de-
couples the upstream and downstream channels, using a low-bandwidth indi-
rect channel for delivering outbound requests (URLs) and a high-bandwidth
direct channel for downloading web content. The upstream channel hides
the request contents using steganographic encoding within Email or instant
messages, whereas the downstream channel uses IP address spoofing so that
the real address of the proxies is not revealed either to legitimate users or
censors. We built a proof-of-concept prototype that uses encrypted VoIP
for this downstream channel and demonstrated the feasibility of using the
CensorSpoofer framework in a realistic environment.},

proven to be extremely sensitive to manipulation by forces in control of the infras-
tructure of the Internet. Along with the growth of The Internet came the growth
of censorship and filtering by governments. Governmental forces across the world
have filtered, blocked and eavesdropped network traffic for both economic and
political reasons.
This thesis focuses on the question of how filtering techniques and data cen-
sorship introduced by overseeing (governmental) forces can be circumvented. The
challenge is to offer a fully autonomous and anonymized network of interconnected
users with high-quality experience.
Along with this research, software has been implemented which enables the
buildup of a file sharing network, where data is hard to trace and downloaders are
indistinguishable from other users of the network. It forms the basis for a future
anonymous network. This thesis and the developed software are a proof-of-concept
which can and will be further developed by the Tribler team at the Delft University
of Technology. This thesis introduces the ‘p2p onion router’, an anonymized net-
work where high bandwidth can be achieved. This makes it more attractive than
alternatives such as TOR for multimedia streaming. A new cryptographic approach
based on the existing counter mode is introduced. This enables packet loss and
packet reordering in stream ciphers, in order to utilize the benefits of BitTorrent
traffic in onion routing.},

  abstract    = {The Internet is a large public network of networks and computers. When no coun-
termeasures are taken, all information and activities taking place on the public
Internet are subject to traffic analysis, threatening personal freedom and privacy.
The first measure to take is securing all transferred information by applying encryp-
tion on it, which makes it at least very hard to tap the contents of the transferred
information. But encryption does not add any value when it comes to anonymity.
Although the contents of the message are not known (because it is encrypted), it
is still possible to track down where a message comes from, and where it is going
to by analyzing the network infrastructure. Governments or Internet providers may
apply censorship or block any kind of network traffic coming or going from some-
where. This is where hidden services come in. The idea of hidden services was
described by the authors of Tor (The onion router). The hidden services protocol
hides the location of both the sender and receiver by transferring and encrypting
messages over multiple hops, without revealing the true identity or contents of the
messages in transit.
This thesis proposes a design for implementing Tor-like hidden services in a de-
centralized peer-to-peer system, enabling the possibility of downloading and seed-
ing anonymously. A proof-of-concept will be implemented into Tribler, a BitTorrent
client developed at Delft University of Technology. Tribler already supports anony-
mous downloading using encryption over circuits with multiple hops, but to make
hidden services work, an end-to-end encrypted circuit between both the seeder
and downloader needs to be established. This is not as easy as it seems, because
the seeder and downloader do not know each other. The implementation details of
hidden services are part of this work, as well as experiments on the performance of
the system. Furthermore, a number of issues related to transforming the original
idea of hidden services into a fully distributed context are solved.},

  abstract    = {The decentralized architecture of peer-to-peer ( P 2 P ) networks solves many of the
limitations of conventional client-server networks. This decentralization, however,
creates the need in P 2 P file sharing networks to find peers who are downloading
the same file, a problem which is referred to as swarm discovery. In the BitTorrent
file sharing network, swarm discovery is solved using a central server (a tracker),
which is unreliable and unscalable.
We have designed a decentralized swarm discovery protocol, called LITTLE BIRD .
L ITTLE BIRD is an epidemic protocol that exchanges swarm information between
peers that are currently or were recently members of a swarm. A quantitative mea-
sure of the contribution of each peer is calculated to make the protocol efficient
and secure against peers that pollute the system with malicious information. Fur-
thermore, we have conducted detailed measurements of the BitTorrent community
’Filelist.org’, in order to study download swarm behavior and optimize the design
of our protocol. We have implemented the LITTLE BIRD protocol as an addition to
the Tribler P 2 P network.
For the evaluation of LITTLE BIRD , we have created an experimental environment
called CROWDED , which enables us to conduct large-scale trace-based emulations
of swarms on the DAS-2 supercomputer. Evaluation results show that our protocol
scales with the swarm size, uses moderate bandwidth overhead, and is resilient
against denial-of-service and pollution attacks. Therefore, LITTLE BIRD enables
secure, scalable and reliable swarm discovery.},

  abstract    = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology allows us to create self-organising and scalable sys-
tems. The distributed nature of these systems requires a solution for finding inter-
esting peers. In the context of P2P file sharing, finding peers who are downloading
the same file is referred to as the swarm discovery problem. In BitTorrent, this
problem is solved using a central server, called a tracker. This central component
hinders the scalability of BitTorrent.
We have designed a distributed swarm discovery algorithm, called 2-Hop Tor-
rentSmell. It is composed of two parts. The first part builds on top of an existing
keyword search system to find peers who have recently downloaded a certain file.
The second part consists of an algorithm called RePEX, which allows a peer to
stay in touch with swarms it is no longer in by periodically recontacting previously
encountered swarm members. Our RePEX algorithm leverages a widely used Bit-
Torrent extension for swarm discovery called PEX. We have conducted a study to
understand the reliability and usability of PEX to optimize the design of our solu-
tion. We have implemented the RePEX part of 2-Hop TorrentSmell as an addition
to the Tribler P2P network.
For the evaluation of our RePEX algorithm, we have tested it on the 10 largest
swarms on a public tracker. In addition, we have deployed the algorithm in a
beta version of Tribler and let it run on swarms the user has downloaded from.
Evaluation results show our algorithm is scalable and effective in popular swarms.},

  abstract    = {Peer-to-peer networks are often large, collaborative networks where peers can join
openly. The essence of a collaborative, distributed system is that every node per-
forms tasks for other nodes. The peers often help in singular interactions and with-
out direct reciprocity. Malicious peers can abuse and freeride the public goods. The
network without countermeasures can fall into a tragedy of the commons where no
one helps another and everyone takes advantage of the generosity of peers. Only
when the reputation of a peer is publicly available at scale and peers trust this repu-
tation can the network escape the problems of freeriding and attain high utility for
all participants.
This thesis focuses on designing and implementing the first step of a tamper
proof reputation system within Tribler. Tribler is a peer-to-peer BitTorrent system
developed at the Delft University of Technology. This first step, made by this the-
sis, is to create MultiChain, a proof-of-concept bookkeeping system. MultiChain
tracks the upload and download amounts of peers to eliminate freeriding. Multi-
Chain is cryptographically protected and validated. The bookkeeping system has
to be scalable to be publicly available and be able to process enough transactions.
The system has to work in an asynchronous network.
A new design of a distributed data structure that can be used as a ledger is in-
troduced by this thesis. This first step with MultiChain is already more resilient
to tampering than previous work, like BarterCast. BarterCast has no security mea-
sures against tampering records. The design of MultiChain is to have a chain of
blocks for every peer as a ledger. Peers are participants of a peer-to-peer network.
A block contains a transaction between two peers. This block is shared and added
to both chains. This makes both chains of the peers intertwined and entangled at
a shared block. The proposed design abandons the typical global, full ledger. The
protocol of creating these blocks between peers is described. The problems faced
by MultiChain in an asynchronous network are explained. The thesis proposes how
the design can overcome these problems by only allowing atomic operations to be
performed on the chain and to introduce unfinished blocks in the chain.
The implementation of the design is tested and experimented with within this
thesis to validate it to work correctly. Furthermore, a number of weak points are
discussed. These weak points have to be addressed in the future to create a tamper
proof reputation system.},

are used in peer-to-peer systems to track the con-
tribution of peers to the community for the purpose
of deterring freeriding and rewarding good behavior.
Most often, peers earn credit for uploading files, but
other activities might be rewarded in the future as
well, such as making useful comments or reporting
spam. Credit earned can be used for accessing new
content, or for receiving preferential treatment in case
of network congestion. We define credit mining as
the activity performed by peers for the purpose of
earning credit. In this paper, we design, implement, and
evaluate a system for decentralized credit mining that
maximizes the contribution of idle peers to the commu-
nity by automatically uploading popular files. Building
on previous theoretical insights into the economics
of communities, we select autonomous algorithms for
bandwidth investment as the basis of our credit mining
system. Additionally, we describe our experience with
important challenges arising from Internet deployment,
that are frequently neglected in emulation, including
duplicate content avoidance, spam prevention, and the
cost of keeping peer information updated. Furthermore,
we implement an archival mode of operation, which
prevents the disappearance of old content from the
community. We show the feasibility and usefulness of
our credit mining system through measurements from
our implementation on top of Tribler, an Internet-
deployed peer-to-peer system.},

is essential to ensure no performance regression has occurred i.e. the program

is the result of ten years scientific research in complex distributed systems. Over the
course of years Tribler’s performance has fallen below acceptable user experience
levels, mainly because there is a lack of software performance engineering.
In this work, we lay the foundations for a regression testing system that allows de-
velopers to continuously monitor the metrics that are having the most impact on the
performance of Tribler. Applying this system gave us a deep insight in the greatest
bottleneck of the performance of Tribler: synchronous, blocking disk operations.
Resolution of this bottleneck includes a major refactoring effort of the message
synchronization system Dispersy. Implementation of a novel, non-blocking disk
operation framework allowed us to increase the throughput of Tribler’s API by up
to 150% and reduce its response times by up to 57.5%.},

  abstract    = {The term technical debt has been used to described the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system
due to expedient shortcuts taken during development, possibly due to financial or time constraints. The term
has gained significant attention in software engineering research and the agile community.

Tribler, a platform to share and discover content in a complete decentralized way, has accumulated a tremen-
dous amount of technical debt over the last ten years of scientific research in the area of peer-to-peer network-
ing. The platform suffers from a complex architecture, an unintuitive user interface, an incomplete and un-
stable testing framework and a large amount of unmaintained code. A new layered, flexible and component-
based architecture that readies Tribler for the next decade of research is proposed and discussed. We lay the
foundations for this new architecture by implementing a RESTful API and a new graphical user interface. By
removing the old user interface, the amount of technical debt in Tribler is dramatically reduced.

Additional work includes the pay off of various kind of technical debt by the means of major improvements
to the testing framework, heavy modifications within the core of Tribler and changes in the infrastructure to
make it more usable and robust. With the deletion of 12.581 lines, the modification of 765 lines and addition
of 12.429 lines, we show that several important software metrics are improved and that we paid off a huge
amount of technical debt. Raising awareness about technical debt in general is of uttermost importance if we
wish to prevent deterioration of the system. Together with a code review policy and static code analysis tools
to track code coverage and the amount of code violations, we hope to prevent huge amounts of technical debt
in the future.

We perform experiments to verify the stability and performance of various components in the core of Tri-
bler and propose future work for the components that require more work. In our final experiment, we will
test Tribler on a large scale and lay the foundations for an application testing framework that is useful for
failure identification.},
