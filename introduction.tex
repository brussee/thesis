Video sharing is a big part of social media nowadays.
Huge video streaming providers like Youtube, Twitch, Periscope, etc. currently dominate the market.
None of them are server-less and do not  provide anonymity in any shape or form.
Social media platforms typically have an incentive to de-anonymize the user to serve targeted advertisement and sell the information about user interests with advertisers.

\section{Tribler}
Tribler introduces a server-less video-sharing platform with privacy enhancing technologies and giving a Youtube-like, social media experience at the same time.
The capability of hiding your identity is greatly advantageous to the user if his or her human rights are violated, like free speech.

The server-less technique of Tribler is resistant to Internet kill-switches that are typically deployed for the purpose of censorship.
