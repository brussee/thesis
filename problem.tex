Automonous operation
the businesmodel of the internet is no user privacy and profiling and targeted advertising



The business model of social media directly conflicts with user privacy. % FINAL

Social media on phones
You want to express freedom of expression with that all the time % Normative, assumption of this thesis



Existing apps use central server design
Vulnarable for Internet kill switches and censorship

Offline viral spreading image (hacking lab)


How I did the work
What you have done told by what you did not do.
No answer completely, with tests that I did, but what I tested says this.... and makes it reasonable to say probably yes.


Image of what I got in the end and what I got in the beginning next to each other.


Is the main question legitimate?


What is the problem this VOD platform solves?


Regulatory perspective, out of scope
Ethical, out of scope


What do we want? VOD
What is already there? p4a
What is the gap? my work

How can we develop an autonomous and anonymous VOD patform with existing python code base that is ()user friendly /) working on a mobile platform and which is resistant to Internet kill-switches?

autonomous, not dependent on outside stuff
user friendly, power draw, special permissions

multicoin, mobile data, nodes/hops



Imperative programming has limitations
Reactive fits mobile paradigm better


Iterations, waterfall?
Delft system approach:
Systeem -> Functional Design -> alternatives -> choose ->Prototype implementation

------			 validation				 <----------------------------------------

KPI 's, speed, availability, ...
or
App is done
Now: multi-criteria analysis of all other apps and mine



What is VOD?
What does working on mobile phone mean?
What are the existing modules we re-use?
What is missing? (gap)
What are the possible solutions?
Is this prototype a verified solution to main problem desc.?


this is depth first analysis now.

NOT product description

\section{Scope}
No routing, no blutooth p2p, mesh networking: that is done by Serval. Out of scope of this work. Add as enhancement later.



maybe problem description in an image, like system diagram
