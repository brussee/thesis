We now present a design to address the challenges and utilize the opportunities of working on a mobile device as put forward in the previous chapter.
First in terms of functionality and other requirements, second the overall system architecture.

Previous attempts at designing a mobile version of Tribler failed to properly separate re-usable components.
This resulted in unmaintainable code and increased difficulty in testing.
We use a top down approach to come to a high level system architecture and in determining the reusable components or the current Tribler application.
% What is the gap?
Some functionality of Tribler has been shown to work on Android before \cite{bsc1,2,3}.
Our design will fill in the gap of connecting the pieces of the grand puzzle to make Tribler fully work on mobile.


\section{Functional requirements}\label{sec:func_req}
% Functional level
% Function design
%Product design involves determining the objectives of the system. Central questions in this process are “what is feasible?”, “what is required?” and “what functions need to be fulfilled by the system?” It is a strategic decision process and it will be termed the function design 
%Function design distinguishes between innovation and improvement. Improvement usually only concerns the reorganisation or reengineering of an existing system, which implies a rearrangement of existing functions or a different interpretation of these functions. Innovation concerns the extension, reduction or modification of functions due to the introduction of new technology, resources and/or organisation.

Following from the problem description and Tribler functionality described in Chapter \ref{ch:tribler}, we define the following functional requirements:

%inputs, commands and conditions
%outputs, conditions
%store, reuse data, backup
%computations
%timing and synchronization

\begin{enumerate}[label=A\arabic*.,ref=A\arabic*]
	
	\item \label{rq:BeamApp} The implementation must be capable of effortless peer-to-peer transfer of itself.
	\item \label{rq:PublishOffline} The implementation must be capable of publishing videos to other devices without the need for an Internet connection.
	\item \label{rq:PublishAny} Any video available on the device must be directly publishable. %acquisition

%Every user must be able create his/her own channel in Tribler to publish their content, just like channels in YouTube, directly from the mobile device.
%Newly discovered channels and content may be added to the GUI without user interaction.


\section{Non-functional requirements}\label{sec:non_func_req}

\end{enumerate}

%Because of the ubiquity of smartphones with built-in camera, one is always at hand and ready to record.
%Such mobile devices are much more manageable than for example laptops with built-in camera, that Tribler has been capable of running on in the past.
%No opportunity should be missed due to hassle of getting a dedicated camera and transferring the recording to a connectible device afterwards.
%Therefore the camera built-in the mobile device should be used to record video or photographs with Tribler.
%The usability of Tribler as a content generating tool is greatly improved by this. 

%Self-created content must be stored on the internal memory and processed automatically on the mobile device itself in order to avoid dependency any external processing unit (req. \ref{rq:Independence}).
%This includes the creation of .torrent files required to share content via the bit-torrent protocol.


\section{System architecture}
% Design level
The requirements dictate how the system architecture of Tribler on mobile devices will take shape.
% Increase re-usability where possible
The proposed architecture as shown in Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture_design} is specifically designed for maintainability and clearly separates components with a distinct responsibility.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{fig:system_architecture_design}
\end{figure}

The requirement (\ref{rq:PythonClibs}) of re-using the Tribler Python core and its C/C++ dependencies requires the architecture to incorporate these as is.
Mobile platforms are not required to support Python code natively and the implementation must be distributed as a single installable package and run independently (req. \ref{rq:Independence}).
As a consequence, a Python interpreter must be incorporated into the implementation.
% Reuse existing designs and code where possible
% What are the existing modules we re-use?
%Having separated the GUI from the back-end, we can easily re-use the Tribler core and replace the outdated wxPython GUI with something modern.
The user must interact with the implementation via a GUI, as stated by requirement \ref{rq:Gui}.
As such a GUI is not part of the Tribler core, it has to be included separately in the design.
% Design for flexibility / adaptability
A separate GUI can be made and optimized for any specific platform and target device. % native user interface interaction.
For instance, a design can be made for large surface displays and another one for small touch-screens, like a smartphone.
This leads to the design choice of creating an API, that allows for a common interface across all platforms, to let the GUI communicate with the existing Tribler core.
The API will yield a more maintainable solution than previous attempts to bring Tribler to mobile devices \cite{tribler2014play,tribler2014at3,tribler-anon-hd} that did not include such an API.
% Divide and conquer
%Recent refactoring of the Tribler code \cite{thesis_martijn} has divided functionality into core modules.
% Increase cohesion where possible
% Reduce coupling where possible
%The purpose of this was to increase cohesion inside modules and the core, and reduce coupling between modules where possible.
%This makes porting the core and individual modules easier.
