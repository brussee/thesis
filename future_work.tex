Future Work



feasibility, opportunities enables future research, fully geared to mobile
het onderzoek staat nu toe om geverifieerd worden op beoogde use-cases.
for the intended use-cases 


shared keychain, credit minging laptop, server, mobile..


NFC is used to share a channel id and to automatically setup a Bluetooth file transfer.
In the future the same method can be used to exchange bootstrap peers for the Tribler network.
The peer-to-peer Bluetooth file transfer could be made much faster if the WiFi Direct would be used.


Thumbnails retrieval and distribution now that video is so important on mobile, could be added on top of groundwork by me.


credit mining on device A, usage on device B


comparative analysis

Automate ad hoc WiFi direct like nfc-bluetooth!

cutting long running methods in smaller pieces, so multi-threading is smoother (only discovered now, earlier: why is gui hanging?)
release GIL in native C code, mainly for heavy crypto tasks
streaming API for big responses (dumping all known channels from db)

knippen voor twisted is gewenst, nu pas zichtbaar weakness in Tribler, nuttig om te verbeteren. (conclusion)


iOS with QtPython
