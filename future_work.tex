% future phd's and new agenda thanks to this work?

This work enables a new direction for future research with Tribler: mobile devices.
A new user group, that does not own desktop computers, gains access to Tribler's privacy enhancing functionality.

The contributions of this work enable future research into Tribler's intended use-cases fully geared towards mobile devices.
Like for example a large scale experiment with various degrees of a powerful censor or a live deployment of Tribler mobile in areas with restricted Internet access to evaluate the effectiveness.



No routing, no blutooth p2p, mesh networking: that is done by Serval. Out of scope of this work. Add as enhancement later.
We won't modify the networking capabilities based on the opportunities because that would warrant a dedicated study.


In API version 18 support is added for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), WiFi scan only mode, key store for app-private keys, hardware credential storage and automated UI testing.


The portability of our design and implementation allows it to be used in other applications like smart-tv's as well.

NFC is used to share a channel id and to automatically setup a Bluetooth file transfer.
In the future the same method can be used to exchange bootstrap peers for the Tribler network. Or integrate into apk just before sending via Bluetooth.
The peer-to-peer Bluetooth file transfer could be made much faster if the WiFi Direct would be used.


Thumbnails retrieval and distribution now that video is so important on mobile, could be added on top of groundwork by me.

Automate ad hoc WiFi direct like nfc-bluetooth!

cutting long running methods in smaller pieces, so multi-threading is smoother (only discovered now, earlier: why is gui hanging?)
release GIL in native C code, mainly for heavy crypto tasks
streaming API for big responses (dumping all known channels from db)

knippen voor twisted is gewenst, nu pas zichtbaar weakness in Tribler, nuttig om te verbeteren. (conclusion)
