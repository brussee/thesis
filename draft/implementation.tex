verdedig P4A keuze
python and toolchain aspect

stable with common tools

What alternatives are there, besides P4A, to run python code on Android?
1. QPython: scripting, cannot build regular .apk
2. PGS4A: no longer in development
3. SL4A: no longer in development
Why is P4A chosen?
Because this project continued from previous work (legacy code) build on P4A.
Even though the revamp version was build from scratch, it still is the best choice because it not only provides the Python interpreter, it also is a complete tool-chain to build a standalone .apk.

Android config changes: don't redo work like disc. channels, use fragments like normal android dev.
