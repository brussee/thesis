Future Work

NFC is used to share a channel id and to automatically setup a Bluetooth file transfer.
In the future the same method can be used to exchange bootstrap peers for the Tribler network.
The peer-to-peer Bluetooth file transfer could be made much faster if the WiFi Direct would be used.


Thumbnails retrieval and distribution now that video is so important on mobile, could be added on top of groundwork by me.
