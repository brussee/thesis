\chapter{Conclusions}
After validating and verifying our design in the previous chapter, we now come to the conclusions with regards to the main research questions.

The research question was: how feasible is it to run all Tribler functionality on mobile devices? % to defeat or mitigate large scale monitoring and censorship?
Secondary question was: using the unique properties of mobile devices, what features can be added or enhanced?

Several benchmarks give raise to some minor considerations.
The profiling revealed that crypto tasks have a significant part in the processing of messages which can be easily offloaded 
the Multichain and profiler ones in particular

Future Work

shared keychain, credit minging laptop, server, mobile..


NFC is used to share a channel id and to automatically setup a Bluetooth file transfer.
In the future the same method can be used to exchange bootstrap peers for the Tribler network.
The peer-to-peer Bluetooth file transfer could be made much faster if the WiFi Direct would be used.


Thumbnails retrieval and distribution now that video is so important on mobile, could be added on top of groundwork by me.


credit mining on device A, usage on device B


comparative analysis
WiFi direct
cutting long running methods in smaller pieces, so multi-threading is smoother (only discovered now, earlier: why is gui hanging?)
release GIL in native C code, mainly for heavy crypto tasks
streaming API for big responses (dumping all known channels from db)

knippen voor twisted is gewenst, nu pas zichtbaar weakness in Tribler, nuttig om te verbeteren. (conclusion)
