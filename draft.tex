Tribler is a fully decentralized search and video-on-demand platform.
It also offers privacy by a TOR-like overlay network 
In addition to that a reputation system is build with blockchain technique.

The research question is now: can Tribler be fully used on mobile devices?

First, what is required to run Tribler on Android?
Tribler is written in Python and uses various libraries written in C++.
To use these libraries on a mobile platform all their dependencies need to be available on that platform.


What alternatives are there to run python code on Android? (QT, P4A, older projects)
Why is P4A chosen: previous work (legacy code), best match

What have I done: cross compiling libraries (dependencies) with python bindings
... etc. (@see "my contributions" in thesis)


Reuse entire existing core
Multi-threading with twisted in python is not perfect: busy reactor thread: API timeouts
Choosen for multi-process: java front-end with python back-end: at least responsive gui with loading indicators



How well does it perform? (per feature / key performance indicator)
Compared to laptop?
Compared to centralized solution? (Youtube)

What advantages does a smart phone have compared to a laptop and desktop?
Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi + p2p, camera, ... etc. all integrated
NFC channel subscription

Reactive programming paradigm on Android

Future work:
comparative analysis
WiFi direct
cutting long running methods in smaller pieces, so multi-threading is smoother (only discovered now, earlier: why is gui hanging?)
release GIL in native C code, mainly for heavy crypto tasks
streaming API for big responses (dumping all known channels from db)

wat heb ik gedaan, dan pas boek erbij


bijdrage: faciliterend voor future research, nuttig. Tribler features + phone benefits
aantonen? ja, nee, beide is resultaat
significance: demo paper, grand challenge
